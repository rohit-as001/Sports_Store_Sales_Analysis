### Note : “Concession” mean in the Order Channel
In sales/retail datasets, Order Channel tells you where or how the sale happened.
The product was sold through a concession counter or partner store, not a standalone store or direct online channel.
One brand sells its products inside another retailer’s store

Example :
- Nike counter inside a large mall store
- Adidas section inside Lifestyle / Shoppers Stop
- A sports brand selling inside a multi-brand retail outlet
So the sale is:
N- ot pure online
- Not company-owned exclusive store
- Not distributor/wholesale
- It’s a shop-in-shop model
